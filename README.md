### What this is
The main project is in the `function_based` directory and this is currently running on an AWS lightsail instance.

This is a forex trading bot written in Python. This is still very much in testing but it works. The algorithim needs work because it could be faster. There are currently a lot of cases that decide if a trade should be placed and I'm wondering if these can be made smaller/easier?

I should also work on implementing this as classes and not just a series of helper functions. On the TODO list.
