### What this is
This is currently running on an AWS lightsail instance. I've cloned this from my private repo and sanitized it of any personal info.

This is a [forex](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/why-trade-forex.asp) trading bot I've written in Python utilizing the [Oanda](https://www.oanda.com/us-en/) trading platform. This is VERY much a work in progress and something I started out of interest in forex and to learn Python. I'm aware it's messy and needs a lot of refactoring but I'm busy so updates are few and far between.

It's current state is "Working PoC" for the trading algorithm. It does the things, makes the trades.
